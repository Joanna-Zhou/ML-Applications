## Project Overview

The **Pic-to-Art** project leverages neural style transfer to convert photographs into pieces of art by combining the content of a target image with the style of a reference artwork. The project explores various neural network architectures and techniques to achieve optimal results.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Primary language for developing and running the project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For implementing and training neural networks.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing results.

## Key Techniques

- **Neural Style Transfer**: Combines content and style from two images using deep neural networks.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Utilized for extracting content and style features.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Used to minimize the loss function and achieve the desired artistic effect.
